# Seven Up
**Simpler and more maintainable backend for the Marando Real Estate Website**

## Strategy
Simple is always best:

There is a Node server that static web requests, filling the client with data that is rehyrated when they parse it
There is a Restify Server that serves as an API backend for the server
There is an S3 Bucket that contains client data
